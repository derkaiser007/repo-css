    <h2>Messi's playing days in Argentina</h2>
    <p>
      A lifelong supporter of Newell's Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club
      when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell's, he
      scored almost 500 goals as a member of "The Machine of '87", the
      near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and
      regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of
      the first team's home games.

    <h2>Messi's playing days in Spain</h2>
    <p>
      At 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, Messi made his first team debut
      when he came on in the 75th minute during a friendly against José
      Mourinho's Porto on 16 November 2003.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional
      career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 35 trophies, including
      10 La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and four UEFA Champions
      Leagues.

    <h2>Messi's playing days in France</h2>

      On 10 August 2021, Messi joined French club Paris Saint-Germain. He signed
      a two-year deal until June 2023 with an option for an extra year. Since
      then, he has been playing for the same club so far.

    <h2>Messi's playing days with Argentine National Team</h2>
    <p>
      Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June 2004, he made his debut for
      his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in
      their victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his country, he won the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World
      Cup.
